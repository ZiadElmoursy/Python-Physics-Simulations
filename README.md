# Python-Physics-Simulations
Personal projects involving simulations of physics, especially ODEs, in python.

# Current Projects
Simple Pendulum:
  The ODE of motion was derived on paper then numerically analyzed and the results animated in python.

# Planned Projects
Simple Double Pendulum:
  The Lagrangian has already been derived on paper. The Euler-Lagrange equation will be applied via python. The computed ODE of motion will then be numerically analyzed and the results animated in python.
